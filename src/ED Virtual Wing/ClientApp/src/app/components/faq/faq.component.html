        <app-h3>What is this application for?</app-h3>
        <p>
            Elite Dangerous has an in-game wing limit of 4 players on the same game version and same game mode.<br>
            A virtual wing allows players to see a live status of more players which are not part of their in-game
            wing.<br>
            This targets squadrons and other groups which regularly exceed the 4 player limit but still want to
            participate in activities together.

        <app-h3>My or some of my wing members data is only transmitted with a delay.</app-h3>
        <p>The Virtual Wing utilizes a real time technology which allows to transmit data to the server and other users
            immediately.<br>
            If the data transfer is notably delayed it is likely caused by the user who's data is transmitted with a
            delay.<br>
            One cause could be that the Virtual Wing application runs as a background tab in the browser, as most modern
            browser throttle scripts of websites in the background.<br>
            Make sure the Virtual Wing application runs in the currently active tab of the browser. You can also open
            the application in a separate browser window.

        <app-h3>What are the limitations?</app-h3>
        <p>Some information are not available in the game journal at this point in time but we apply whatever we have as
            good as possible.
            However, you will encounter the following limitations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shields: We can only show if shields are up or down, not the percentage. When shields are up, you see 3
                rings around the ship, none if they are down. There is nothing between those two states.</li>
            <li>Hull: We can only read the hull value when it goes down in 20% steps. Repairing the hull using repair
                limpets does not give enough information for us to reflect it properly.</li>
            <li>Interdiction: We display the interdiction status but we cannot show the progress. Instead we show two
                half filled bars (for both attacker and defender) while the interdiction is ongoing.</li>
            <li>Signal sources: If you target a signal source and then drop down from supercruise we do not have a
                reliable way to figure out if you really dropped down at that signal source or if you missed the target
                or did an emergency FSD drop. In both cases we might display you at the signal source.</li>
        </ul>

        <app-h3>Which browsers are supported?</app-h3>
        <p>
            Currently it seems only Chromium based browsers support the required functionality to read your game journal
            files with your permission.<br>
            The most popular Chromium based browsers are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium/" target="_blank">Chromium</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge" target="_blank">Microsoft Edge</a></li>
        </ul>
        However, we hope other browsers will support the required functionality very soon.
